AutoMine.ahk - main branch code

AutoMineExperi - experimental copy that does not work as I wanted it

Checking for chest below the player does not work correctly, causes the player to try correct it's alignment when its not supposed to

Apart from that, the scripts are the same.

Also, it does not start trying to check for chest below player for 5 blocks due to the colour differences at the top layer of dirt.
